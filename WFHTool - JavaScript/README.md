<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This WFHTool extension solves 4 major challenges in a work from home environment.

1. Motivation - This extension makes an attempt to keep up the motivation by displaying <strong>motivational quotes</strong> which will get updated every day,every 25 minutes and on click of the quote area.
2. Distractions - In my opinion, distractions are the major blockers to be more productive at work, So this tool will provide you a way where you can add all the sites that are causing your distractions and <strong>block them</strong>. Can <strong>unblock and delte</strong> a site from the list at anytime in case of urgency!
3. Organising - Organising plays a very important role in getting things done in a effective manner. This extension provides a todo list where you can add the things that needs attention and can keep track on them by using a checkbox when completed and delete if not necessary to be displayed on the list.
4. Prioritizing - Sometimes having a list of todos is not sufficient to prioritize . A decision making matrix can come in handy in such situations. This helps in prioritizing the todos according to their importance and urgency. Please refer to this to know more about decision making matrix [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-matrix_method] <br>
