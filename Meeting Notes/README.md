# Meeting Notes
Meeting Notes help you open, save & manage meeting notes whenever you open a new tab. This is built as a Chrome extension to help people manage their notes simultaneously when they are in a meeting in another tab.

It can also be used as a To-Do list. I've used the Firebase Realtime database to store the notes. <br>

## Features :sparkles:

- Save, delete, update notes on the go.
- Add Emoticons as note icons.
- Maintain it as a To-Do list and update the same.
