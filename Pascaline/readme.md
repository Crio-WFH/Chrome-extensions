# Pascaline
    a simple calculator for all your need!
Pascaline is a Chrome extension whichÂ can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculations, which are useful when working in a browser and need a simple calculation. So there's no need to switch browsers; simply launch your extension and the calculator will appear.

# Summary
>- **Reason behind this particular idea**<br>

I required a simple calculation while filling out a form a few days ago, so I decided to download an extension for it. I browsed through the Chrome store but couldn't found a calculator with a nice user interface. So, at the time, I decided to make one myself. So, here we are and "Pascaline" was the first calculator ever made, so I decided to go with this name.
