## To-Do Extension

### Summary 

This is a To-Do Extension and the lists or tasks that you add wonâ€™t be removed when you refresh the page and in this to-do extension there are also features of pending tasks number and you can also delete all tasks that you have added on single click.

A to-do list is a list of tasks you need to complete or things that you want to do, at first, there is a content box that holds only the input field with some buttons and text. When you entered some characters and click on the plus (+) button, the list will be added to your tasks list and the number of the pending tasks also be updated. You can also delete each list by clicking on the trash icon, and remember this trash icon only appear on hover on the particular list and delete all tasks with a single click.

It's also changing its background color automatically so that the user can't be bored with the same background :)

- Languages I have used to make this: Html, css & Javascript
