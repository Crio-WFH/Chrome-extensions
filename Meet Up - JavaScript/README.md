# Chrome-Extension-MeetUp
Its a simple extension which store all your meeting links together in one place and in one click you can join quickly.
- This Extension is Built using Javascript and follows all Chrome's **Content Security Policy** Restrictions.
- It also uses **Local Storage**, so your links are not deleted when exited.
- For better UI, I have used frameworks l like **Bootstrap 5** and **JQuery**.
- Its Easy, Fast and Reliable tool for all your meet links.
